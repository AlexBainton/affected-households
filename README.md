# Affected households

Analyse infrastructure affects within a radius using 2021 census data. Data is pulled from the [2021 Census datapacks](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/datapacks).

Start with:

```
source("./01-setup.R")
source("./02-functions.R")
```

This will load dependencies and the functions to use. After this, have a look at the `03-analysis-housing.R` file for examples of using these functions to get the graphs you want.
